## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
PROJECT 1
R Scripts and Reproducible Research: write R script contain function (name whatever) for cleansing data, data manipulation, and get information of your data. This function contains of :
 a. reads retail.csv file (or your own datasets).
 b. perform transform (as.Date dll) if you need.
 c. perform data manipulation (xtabs or aggregate based on your need and creativity).
 d. export cross tabulation OR plot as output (based on your need or creativity).
 
```{r}
retail <- read.csv("data_input/retail.csv")
installed.packages("data.table")
library("data.table")
retail1 <- fread("data_input/retail.csv")

# lihat jenis atribut dari tabel retail
str(retail1);
#ubah jenis atribut
head(retail1$`Order Date`,10)
tail(retail1$`Order Date`,10)
#karena terilhat bahwa urutan datenya bulan/tanggal/tahun
retail1$`Order Date`<-as.Date(retail1$`Order Date`,"%m/%d/%y")
str(retail1)
retail1$`Ship Date`<-as.Date(retail1$`Ship Date`,"%m/%d/%y")
retail1$`Ship Mode`<-as.factor(retail1$`Ship Mode`)
retail1$Segment<-as.factor(retail1$Segment)
retail1$Category<-as.factor(retail1$Category)
retail1$`Sub-Category`<-as.factor(retail1$`Sub-Category`)


```


PROJECT 2
Reproducible Data Science: create RMarkdown file to report your business recommendation based on your data. This Rmarkdown combines :
 a. Markdown title, author name, date.
 b. Add formatting styles and hierarchical structure in your markdown (such as add title using # head, subtitle using ##, add tabset, etc).
 c. Data Explanation.
 d. read your data into R.
 e. Step-by-step data transformation code with some explanatory text (contain 'chunk' and also the markdown).
 f. Exploratory text and business recommendation based on your own creativity.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
